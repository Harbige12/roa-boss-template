# Installation

Start by downloading the boss template, and put the BossTemplate folder in your Rivals of Aether app data folder, under the "stages/" folder.
Please make sure to rename BossTemplate to something else, and before uploading the item, replace the preview.

# Updating

If the template is updated, all you need to do is replace these files:

* article6_draw.gml
* article6_init.gml
* article6_update.gml
* article16_draw.gml
* article16_init.gml
* article16_update.gml
* draw_hud.gml
* init.gml
* other_init.gml
* player_death.gml
* update.gml

There will be update versions of each release only including these files, so if you need to update, you'd just need to download the update version and replace the folder's contents.
